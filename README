This is a folder storing lecture notes I took when I was a young PhD student. My ex-advisor Paul Loya wanted to turn the material into two books. However nothing was being done, partly due to his family problems. I do not think the notes will ever be published. Warning: Please use it as a reference, there are numerous mistakes in the notes.
